-- How it works ?
======================================================================
*The service script
The service script starts and stops the daemon.
For debian users :
   Use 'sudo /etc/init.d/braincracks start' to manually start the service (it is started automatically when the system boots up).
   Use 'sudo /etc/init.d/braincracks stop' to manually stop the service (it is stoped automatically when the system shutdown).

*daemon script
The daemon script launches a versioner script instance for each folder specified in the folder.lst file.
When it receives a stoping signal (SIGINT or SIGTERM) it tells each versioner's started instance to stop their job and exit cleanly.

*versioner script
takes two parameters (given by the daemon script).
The first is the path of the folder to monitor, the second is the delay between checks/backups.
Then it starts a loop made of :
1. check files changes
2. backup files which have changed
3. sleep (programmatically : wait) until the delay is reached
When it receives a stoping signal (SIGINT or SIGTERM) it stops its current job and exit cleanly.
Throughout the process, 2 files are used :
- a lock file created prevent being ran twice.
- a process file updated to mark the folder as "watched" to prevent being watched twice.
To check for files changes the script use the find command and gets files changed since a timestamp's file reference.
To backup files, the script re-creates the folder hierarchy and puts a copy of the file (suffixed by the current time)
